_[Speech-to-text technology](https://en.blog.autoscrib.com/Here-is-what-makes-a-good-voice-assistant), also known as voice recognition or dictation software, converts spoken words into written text. It brings many benefits to students and supports any types of learning method._

## Learning disabilities

Students with learning disabilities, such as dyslexia, dysgraphia, or ADHD, may struggle with traditional written assignments. Speech-to-text technology allows them to speak their ideas out loud, reducing the cognitive load associated with writing and typing.

## Physical disabilities

Students with physical disabilities, such as paralysis or limited mobility, may find it difficult to use a keyboard or a pen and paper. Speech-to-text technology allows them to dictate their thoughts without the need for manual dexterity.

## Time management

Speech-to-text technology can be a valuable tool for students who struggle with time management. By dictating their assignments, they can complete them more quickly and efficiently.

## Multitasking

Some students may benefit from speech-to-text technology when they need to multitask. For example, they may need to take notes during a lecture while also watching a presentation. By dictating their notes, they can focus on the presentation without missing important information.

## Language barriers

For students who are learning a new language, speech-to-text technology can be a valuable tool for improving their writing skills. They can practice their pronunciation and grammar by dictating their ideas and then seeing them written out on the screen.
