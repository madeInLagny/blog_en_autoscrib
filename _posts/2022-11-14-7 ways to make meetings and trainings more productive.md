_Speech recognition technology developed by autoScrib helps you increase your productivity during meetings, face-to-face or online trainings, and even lessons and tutorials. It allows you to take exhaustive and instant notes._

Did you know that nearly [84% of professionals spend 12 hours or less](https://www.dialpad.com/blog/video-conferencing-report/#time-spent-in-meetings) each week in meetings? The amount of data shared every day in video conferencing and live meetings has never been greater. Tracking and managing information becomes complicated.

This is where a transcription solution, also called [speech recognition](https://en.blog.autoscrib.com/Here-is-what-makes-a-good-voice-assistant/) or automatic dictation, can help.

Automatic speech to text conversion allows you to focus on the content, take notes and save a lot of time searching for information.

That's how.

## Take quality notes no matter what language you speak

Instant transcription can also help in learning a foreign language. You can choose from dozens of languages ​​and dialects. Listen and read the foreign language text simultaneously to understand better and learn faster.
